OldQLearn.py (Baseline Q-Learn Model): The file uses q_table.json to store the weights. In order to change the static test map used (1-4), must change in code line 218
QLearn.py (Double Q-Learn Model): The file uses q_table2.json to store the weights. In order to change the static test map used (1-4), must change in code line 237

DQN_nor_torch (Double DQN Model): Uses the dqn_nor.pth weights
DQN5_torch (Double DQN with Experience Replay Model): Uses trained_model.pth weights

grid.py: For generating random maps and testing on pre-defined maps
obstacles.py: For dynamic obstacles generation
util.py: For utils like environment to partial vision and reward shaping
